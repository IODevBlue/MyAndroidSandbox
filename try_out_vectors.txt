1. Morphing Icons
Example: hamburger → close (☰ → ✕)
The paths smoothly morph into each other.
You can use pathData animations in the animator XML.
Great for menu buttons.

2. Progress to Success Animation
Circle → animates as a progress spinner.
When done, morphs into a checkmark inside the circle.
Combines rotation, trim paths, and morphing.

3. Lottie-Style Micro Animations
Heart button ❤️ → tap → explodes into particles → shrinks back.
Doable by combining scale + alpha on groups.
Can layer multiple paths for the “explosion”.

4. Download to Complete
Arrow pointing down → animates into a progress bar → bar fills up → transforms into a checkmark.
Multi-stage state animation with different animators in sequence.

5. Face Expressions
A simple smiley face:
Eyes blink with trimPath
Mouth morphs from neutral → smile → wink
Could be triggered by states (happy, thinking, done).

6. Music Equalizer Bars
Animated vertical bars with infinite loop scale animations.
Different durations + interpolators per bar to look natural.
Can tie it to audio later.
